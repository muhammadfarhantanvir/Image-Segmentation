# Image-Segmentation
Being a practitioner in Machine Learning, you must have gone through an image classification, where the goal is to assign a label or a class to the input image. Now, suppose you want to get where the object is present inside the image, the shape of the object, or what pixel represents what object. In such a case, you have to play with the segment of the image, from which I mean to say to give a label to each pixel of the image. The goal of Image Segmentation is to train a Neural Network which can return a pixel-wise mask of the image.

In the real world, Image Segmentation helps in many applications in medical science, self-driven cars, imaging of satellites and many more. Image Segmentation works by studying the image at the lowest level.
